## Introduction

Despite the growing recognition that the health of animals, people, and their shared environment are inseparably linked, effective surveillance systems collecting, analyzing, and responding to wildlife health data remain uncommon or deficient (One Health High-Level Expert Panel (O...; Machalaba et al. 2021). This deficit is especially relevant in protected areas, Nature’s last strongholds (Mittermeier et al. 2011). Human encroachment around and within these areas and illegal activities can lead to contamination, poisoning events, wildlife extraction, the introduction of domestic animals, and the creation of human-wildlife-livestock interfaces (Meng et al. 2023; Dudley and Stolton 1999; Singh et al. 2021; Laurance et al. 2012; Vicente et al. 2021; Machalaba et al. 2020). These interfaces facilitate pathogen pollution and transmission, disease emergence, pathogen maintenance, and epidemics that can have catastrophic consequences for conservation efforts and planetary health.

A known example is Ebola virus disease which has decimated populations of western gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and specific sub-species of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) within and beyond protected areas (Whitfield 2003, Leroy et al. 2004, Bermejo et al. 2006). The index cases of several human outbreaks have systematically been identified in or near protected areas  (Judson et al. 2016), outbreaks in wildlife have preceded human outbreaks (Rouquet et al. 2005) and, in 2014, this disease reached urban areas of West Africa through human-to-human transmission resulting in over 20,000 excess deaths (Dudas et al. 2017, Jacob et al. 2020, Onyekuru et al. 2023). Furthermore, several protected areas overlap modeled potential hotspots of disease emergence (Jones et al. 2008; Allen et al. 2017). Therefore, the lack of wildlife health monitoring in protected areas leaves blatant gaps in biodiversity conservation and global health security. 

Leveraging the presence of field actors at key interfaces offers a sound strategy to establish baseline wildlife health monitoring at a minimal cost (IUCN and EcoHealth Alliance 2022; Tomaselli et al. 2018; Vila et al. 2019; Kuisma et al. 2019; Orozco et al. 2020; Machalaba et al. 2021; Worsley-Tonks et al. 2022; Aguilar-Vargas et al. 2022; World Health Organization et al. 2023; Zimmerman et al. 2022). Rangers, wildlife biologists, community members, and other field conservation actors conducting patrols in protected areas (hereafter “rangers”) are responsible for conservation and law enforcement. On a global scale, they patrol vast territories that encompass critical ecosystems and wildlife-livestock-human interfaces where they can detect injured, sick, and dead animals (Wolf et al. 2019; Vila et al. 2019; Kuisma et al. 2019; Montecino-Latorre et al. 2020; Orozco et al. 2020; Porco et al. 2023). The few documented isolated initiatives that explicitly report the participation of rangers in wildlife health monitoring have effectively demonstrated their potential to provide data to assess health risks, conduct trend assessments, or trigger outbreak responses including for dangerous diseases of global and conservation concern (Wolf et al. 2019; Vila et al. 2019; Kuisma et al. 2019; Montecino-Latorre et al. 2020; Orozco et al. 2020; Porco et al. 2023). Ranger-based wildlife health monitoring can strengthen One Health surveillance systems (Machalaba et al. 2021; Hayman et al. 2023; Worsley-Tonks et al. 2022; Pruvot et al. 2023; Zimmerman et al. 2022). 

Technology can boost the integration of rangers into health surveillance systems. The “Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool” (SMART) is a suite of technological tools designed to administer protected areas and is currently used in over one thousand sites in more than one hundred countries under multiple languages (Cronin et al. 2021; SMART Partnership ). Its field-ready technology, SMART Mobile, is already in the hands of thousands of rangers supporting the standardized digital documentation of user-determined “incidents” of conservation interest (e.g., fire, illegal hunting) and their instant reporting to decision-makers. The engagement of the large community of ranger SMART-users to document “health incidents” in protected areas represents a promising opportunity to generate a worldwide network of sentinels at critical ecosystems and wildlife-livestock-human interfaces.

However, to date there has been a lack of baseline information regarding current general wildlife health monitoring practices in protected areas worldwide, the current mandates of rangers to document patrol findings of health interest, and practical and technical obstacles to leveraging them in wildlife health monitoring. To address this gap, we conducted a survey targeting protected area data managers belonging to the global SMART user community to assess: i) their perceptions regarding wildlife health and One Health, ii) the detection of dead, sick, or injured wildlife, and domestic animals in protected areas and their documentation, iii) health data management in SMART databases, and iv) the current status of SMART deployment in protected areas.


## Methods

We developed a web-based questionnaire aimed at protected area managers. The survey had five sections. Under section 1, we asked managers to rank their overall agreement with the affirmations: "Wildlife health, including infectious and non-infectious diseases, is important to achieve the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work", "Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work in", "Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect public health", and "Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect livestock health".


<!-- Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work  -->

<!-- Wildlife health, including infectious and non-infectious diseases, is important to achieve the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work -->


<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect livestock health    -->


<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect public health -->


<!-- Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work  -->

Under section 2, we requested managers to rank the overall frequency of encounters with dead, sick, or injured wildlife in protected areas and their documentation when found during patrols.


<!-- Are dead animals encountered in the protected area?  -->

<!-- Are sick or injured animals encountered in the protected area?  -->


<!-- Are healthy wildlife found during patrols (rangers or others) recorded as a specific category of individuals? -->

<!-- 12.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how healthy wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 12.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 13. Are dead wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 13.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how dead wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 13.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 14. Are injured wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 14.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how injured wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 14.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 15. Are sick wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 15.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how sick wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->


Under section 3, we asked managers to rank their agreement with the affirmation "Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work". We also assess the presence of domestic animals at these sites and their recording, including health status. Likert scales were used in sections 1 - 3, specifically in those questions involving rankings.


<!-- Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work -->

<!-- 16. Are domestic animals found in the protected area (free-ranging, captive, on a farm)? -->

<!-- 17. If observed on a patrol, is the presence of domestic animals recorded? -->

<!-- 18. Is the health status of the observed domestic animals (healthy, sick or injured, dead) recorded? -->


Under section 4, we asked about data storage practices. 


<!-- Are these data entered and stored in SMART Desktop? -->

<!-- If none of the items are recorded in the corresponding SMART Conservation Area where are they recorded?  -->

Under section 5, we asked about the current state of SMART and its components. 

<!-- 21. What version of SMART Desktop is currently used in the protected area? -->
<!-- 22. Is SMART Connect available to manage and transfer information between SMART Desktop and SMART Mobile?  -->

<!-- 22.a Are there plans to set up SMART Connect instance and when? -->

<!-- 23. Is SMART fully rolled-out in the protected area(s) you work in or is it being piloted? -->


An introductory webpage explained that the survey was voluntary, anonymous, aimed at protected area managers administering SMART data. The webpage also clarified that clicking the "Start the survey" button constituted consent. The survey was built on Google Forms, which has a translation tool. We provided a tutorial on translating it into the preferred language (https://sites.google.com/wcs.org/smarttorecordwildlifehealth/home). The survey was exempt from IRB review (ref #22-53 Wildlife Conservation Society Internal Review Board).

The survey was distributed globally to the SMART Community (SMART Community Forum users https://forum.smartconservationtools.org/) by the SMART Partnership via email in October 2022, and it remained open for three months. As the closing date approached, a reminder was sent to the SMART Community three weeks in advance.

```

Responses could represent a single or multiple protected areas. However, our analysis focused on responses representing one or two individual terrestrial protected areas to gain insights into specific local realities. Therefore, responses representing more than two protected areas were filtered out. The resulting dataset could have a specific protected area represented by single responses, by responses that included two protected areas, or a combination of both. We duplicated the responses that were representing two protected areas but left a single protected area for each one, so each row in the dataset implied a unique protected area. One of the responses representing the same protected area after this step were filtered out to leave a unique representation completion and consistency of answers, and respondent's alignment with the intended target audience of the survey.

## Results

### General results

The total number of responses was `r number_responses_before_unknown_pa_names_are_removed`. 

`r as.character(english::as.english(number_responses_before_unknown_pa_names_are_removed-number_responses_after_audience_remove) |> stringr::str_to_title()` responses were removed because the protected area names were not provided, contained only marine protected areas, or the respondent did not match the target audience (`r number_responses_before_unknown_pa_names_are_removed-number_responses_after_unknown_pa_names_are_removed`, `r number_responses_before_marine_remove-number_responses_after_marine_remove`, and `r number_responses_before_audience_remove-number_responses_after_audience_remove` ), respectively. Therefore, the final dataset contained `r nrow(terrestrial_data)` answered surveys from `r length(sort(unique(unlist(map(terrestrial_data$protected_area, \(x) x$country)))))` countries. `as.character(english::as.english(terrestrial_data %>% filter(local==T) %>% count() %>% pull() |> stringr::str_to_title()` were local responses from `r length(unique(unlist(map(terrestrial_data[terrestrial_data$local==T,]$protected_area, \(x) x$country))))` countries and `r terrestrial_data %>% filter(local==F) %>% count() %>% pull()` were global responses from `r length(unique(unlist(map(terrestrial_data[terrestrial_data$local==F,]$protected_area, \(x) x$country))))` countries. Results from general responses are provided in the Appendix.

The recording method reported to document either sick, injured, or dead wildlife when found during a patrol varied (considering the local `r recording_of_sick_injured_or_dead_wildlife %>% nrow()` responses reporting the documentation of either dead, sick, or injured wildlife). Most often, each animal was documented individually across health status. Another frequent reporting method was via a full inventory of healthy, sick, injured, or dead animals for each species involved. Sometimes, sick, injured, or dead wildlife were recorded as present/absent or in some other fashion. The distribution of the recording methods across healthy, sick, injured, or dead wildlife is shown in Fig 3.

For the subset of local protected area data managers reporting the documentation of either sick, injured, or dead wildlife (`r data_smart_sick`, `r data_smart_injured`, and `r data_smart_dead` responses, respectively), their data was often stored in a SMART database (Fig 6).

When sick, injured, or dead wildlife were registered but their data was not stored in a SMART database (“None of these items are entered in a SMART database”), a range of options were employed instead, including paper forms, reports, and spreadsheets.

## Discussion

We developed a web-based questionnaire aimed at protected area managers around the globe to learn about their perceptions regarding wildlife health; the monitoring of dead, sick, and injured wildlife and domestic animals in protected areas; health data storage practices at these sites; and local status of SMART. We obtained 71 valid responses from protected area managers that involved 76 protected areas administered with the support of a version of SMART  distributed in 19 countries. Responses from stakeholders strongly suggest that large amounts of valuable and syndromic no-cost data for One Health surveillance are being lost due to non-collection, non-standard recording, or inadequate management. 

Managers usually considered wildlife health as relevant for conservation goals of protected areas and they understand that pathogens can be transmitted and among wildlife, humans, and livestock and impact any of these groups. Several managers confirmed that dead, sick, or injured wildlife are observed at least "very rarely" but 25% to over 50% of them, depending on the wildlife health status category, reported non-recording of these animals when found during patrols. These contradictory answers could be explained by recent global pathogen-driven crises such as SARS-CoV-2, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Ebola Fever virus, and African Swine Fever virus that might have sensitized our audience by the time the survey was responded but before eventual new health-associated monitoring objectives could be planned and rolled-out in the represented conservation sites. Most valid responses (`r terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>%  select(n) %>% max()`; `r  round(terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>% select(n) %>% max()/ terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>%  select(n) %>% sum *100,2)`%) came from `r terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>% arrange(-n) %>% filter(n==max(n)) %>% pull(country)` where two major wildlife die-offs have recently occurred: H5N1 HPAI since November 2022 (Paulo citation), after the survey was closed, and the largest oil-spill in its history in January 2022, before the survey was sent. After excluding responses from this country, the distribution of perceptions regarding wildlife health and recording of dead, sick, or injured wildlife remain (Appendix 3), so neither of these die-offs or particular Peruvian responses explained the contradiction.  

The subgroup of managers representing protected areas where sick, injured, or dead wildlife found during patrols are recorded provided several methodologies to register these animals (present/absent, individually, or grouped within a species) and they could be different within the same response depending on wildlife health status (e.g., sick versus dead wildlife). Specific information collected also varied across and within each wildlife group (demographic data, signs in animals, etc.) with only species and photographs being consistently recorded. Although harmonization of data is a foundational pillar of wildlife health surveillance systems (Lawson et al. 2021; Sleeman et al. 2012; Stephen et al. 2018; Merianos 2007; Worsley-Tonks et al. 2022; World Bank and Food and Agriculture O...; Pruvot et al. 2023; Machalaba et al. 2021; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; Stephen and Berezowski 2022; Ryser-Degiorgis 2013; Hayman et al. 2023; World Organisation for Animal Health ...)  these responses are not be surprising as data standards have been absent in wildlife health historically and globally (e.g., artois 2009 Machalaba, Heiderich, 2023). This scenario can seriously limit the value of health monitoring data from protected areas, hindering the generation of meaningful information, sharing, and timely health assessments within and across conservation sites or beyond.

Most managers "Agree" or "Strongly agree" with the affirmation "Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work" and reported the presence of these animals in the protected area(s). Most responses also confirmed the recording of domestic animals but only a minority reported the registration of their health status. Wildlife can be impacted by domestic animals directly through predation, competition, inter-breeding, or disturbance and indirectly through land-use change (citation). Further, pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife can seriously harm biodiversity conservation efforts. Documented evidence has shown that domestic animal sourced pathogens can cause the extinction of species and disrupt entire ecosystems. Examples include Canine distemper and Pest du Petit Ruminants viruses, *Pastereulla multocida* or *Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis*, *Sarcoptes scabiei* and many others (citations()).  In a world with active encroachment into natural habitats, ubiquitous stressors for wildlife, and continuous disease emergence at human-wildlife-livestock interfaces, we encourage the documentation and categorization of domestic animals found in protected areas by health status.

SMART is available to support the management of protected areas; however, health information was not necessarily managed using a SMART database. The alternatives mentioned almost guarantee information sparsity and the loss of health data. Adequate data management, including the use of appropriate databases, is another foundational pillar of wildlife health surveillance systems; however, most countries do not have such systems and flawed data governance remains a common pitfall. Consequently, these responses are also not surprising but it is important to remark that SMART databases are ready to support the adequate management of ranger-collected health data.

Ranger health data has supported risk assessments, establishment of trends, and serve as early warning systems for disease outbreaks and survey responses confirm that rangers can detect non-healthy wildlife including dead animals. Currently, there are approximately 280,000 rangers worldwide and it is estimated that 1.5 million will be needed by 2030 to properly fulfill the goal to protect 30% of the planet. The current and projected number of rangers reveals the unique cost-effective potential of their recruitment as "health sentinels" and address fundamental gaps in global health security.  

However, survey responses revealed several issues must be addressed. First, the standardized documentation of dead, sick injured, and health animals is imperative. A clear definition of a health event for the "ranger audience" that encompasses wildlife and domestic animals stratified by health status, free-ranging or not, within a specified spatio-temporal unit must be established. The variables to be recorded from each event must also be defined and they should include environmental findings, photographs, species, health status, anomalies observed, and potential causes of disease, injury, or death among others without adding major burden to their duties. Secondly, a database to guarantee the proper governance of ranger documented health events must be put in place. SMART is a sustainable and long-term developed technology that can help addressing these two limitations and move forward to establish a common set of standards not only within protected area agencies jurisdictions but beyond country boundaries and build a ranger-based army of planetary health workers with their boots on the ground and eyes on the field. Although rangers and SMART are already on site, resources and training to bridge their health monitoring capacities must not be discounted.

The vision to build this army has already started. WildHealthNet, a Wildlife Conservation Society initiative, focuses on creating national surveillance networks and codifying their Standard Operation Procedures (Denstedt et al. 2021, Porco et al. 2023, Pruvot et al. 2023). Under WildHealthNet, rangers are explicitly included as health sentinels in protected areas capitalizing on contemporary SMART technology. Currently, rangers from Lao, Peru, and Guatemala have been integrated into health monitoring using the same standards and rangers from Cambodia and Madagascar will be engaged during 2024. 

## Conclusions

The information collected through our survey suggests that: i) protected area managers tend to considered wildlife health as relevant for the conservation goals of protected areas and there is a general understanding from these stakeholders that pathogens can be transmitted among wildlife, humans, and livestock and impact any of these groups; ii) dead, sick, or injured wildlife might not be recorded if found during ranger patrols in protected areas; iii) dead, sick, and injured wildlife found in patrols and documented are recorded following different methodologies within and among protected areas; iv) domestic animals tend to be considered a concern for the conservation goals of protected areas by protected area managers, they are usually observed within their boundaries and recorded, but their health status is mostly not documented; v) health data collected from protected areas supported by SMART might not be properly managed as this information is either not stored or it is partially stored in a SMART database and the alternatives employed are not adequate. Consequently, large amounts of valuable syndromic non-cost data for health monitoring collected by rangers that could be included in One Health surveillance systems are currently being lost. With the right strategies, technology, and investments, rangers can play a crucial role in monitoring health.
