## Introduction

Despite the growing recognition that the health of animals, people and their shared environment are intrinsic and inseparably linked, effective surveillance systems collecting, analyzing, and responding to wildlife health data remain uncommon or deficient. This deficit is especially relevant in biodiverse areas facing land use change and other anthropogenic pressures causing the degradation of landscape immunity (Plowright et al. 2021) and the creation of human-wildlife-livestock interfaces that facilitate pathogen transmission and disease emergence. 

Many protected areas overlap hotspots of infectious disease emergence and past emergence events have shown their impact for conservation efforts, ecosystems, and people living within, nearby, and well beyond their boundaries. The lack of wildlife health surveillance at these sites yields fundamental gaps in the conservation of biodiversity and global health security.

Leveraging stakeholders who are already present at key interfaces offers an sound strategy to establish baseline health surveillance at a minimal cost (IUCN and EcoHealth Alliance 2022). Rangers and other natural resource authorities (hereafter “rangers”), are responsible for field conservation and law enforcement in protected areas. On a global scale, they patrol vast territories that encompass critical wildlife-livestock-human interfaces where they can detect injured, sick, and dead animals. 

While the concept of leveraging rangers for wildlife health surveillance is not new, there are few documented isolated initiatives that explicitly report the participation of rangers in scanning or syndromic surveillance. These initiatives have effectively demonstrated the potential of patrolling rangers to provide data to assess health risks, conduct trend assessments, and trigger outbreak responses Montecino-Latorre et al. (2020) including for dangerous zoonotic diseases of global concern such as Ebola fever disease (Kuisma et al. (2019).

Technology can support the recruitment of rangers as health sentinels. The “Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool” (SMART) is a suite of technological tools designed to administer protected areas by supporting data management, the collection of digital data following user-built data models, and facilitate data communication among key stakeholders. SMART is currently used in over one thousand protected areas in more than one hundred countries under multiple languages (SMART Partnership n.d.) and its user base is continuously growing. Its field-targeted technology, SMART Mobile, is already in rangers' hands distributed globally supporting the standardized documentation of "incidents" they found during patrols ready to be transferred to decision makers. 

This community of SMART-user rangers could be recruited under a common set of SMART-based standards to document "health incidents". These rangers represent a promising opportunity not only to empower them as planetary health workers but to generate a worldwide network of health sentinels at key interfaces under a common framework and fulfill fundamental gaps in global health security. 

However, to date there is a lack of baseline information regarding current health monitoring practices in protected areas, the mandates that rangers have to document health-related events, and existing practical and technical obstacles to leveraging them as health sentinels. For this reason, we conducted a survey targeting protected area managers worldwide belonging to the SMART user community to assess: i) if they consider wildlife health relevant from a One Health perspective, ii) if dead, sick, or injured wildlife and domestic animals are observed in protected areas and recorded by rangers, iii) how are these animals currently documented (when recorded), iv) if these data (when collected) is stored in SMART databases, and v) the current status of SMART components in protected areas. 

## Methods

We developed a web-based questionnaire aimed at protected area managers. The survey had five sections. Under section 1, we asked managers to rank their overall agreement with the affirmations: "Wildlife health, including infectious and non-infectious diseases, is important to achieve the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work", "Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work in", "Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect public health", and "Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect livestock health".


<!-- Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work  -->

<!-- Wildlife health, including infectious and non-infectious diseases, is important to achieve the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work -->


<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect livestock health    -->


<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect public health -->


<!-- Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work  -->

Under section 2, we requested managers to rank the overall frequency of encounters with dead, sick, or injured wildlife in protected areas and their documentation when found during patrols.


<!-- Are dead animals encountered in the protected area?  -->

<!-- Are sick or injured animals encountered in the protected area?  -->


<!-- Are healthy wildlife found during patrols (rangers or others) recorded as a specific category of individuals? -->

<!-- 12.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how healthy wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 12.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 13. Are dead wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 13.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how dead wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 13.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 14. Are injured wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 14.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how injured wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->

<!-- 14.b Please indicate what type of data are recorded (check all that apply) -->


<!-- 15. Are sick wildlife found during patrols recorded as a specific category of individuals?  -->

<!-- 15.a Please select one of the choices below to help us understand how sick wildlife are recorded during a patrol: -->


Under section 3, we asked managers to rank their agreement with the affirmation "Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work". We also assess the presence of domestic animals at these sites and their recording, including health status. Likert scales were used in sections 1 - 3, specifically in those questions involving rankings.


<!-- Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work -->

<!-- 16. Are domestic animals found in the protected area (free-ranging, captive, on a farm)? -->

<!-- 17. If observed on a patrol, is the presence of domestic animals recorded? -->

<!-- 18. Is the health status of the observed domestic animals (healthy, sick or injured, dead) recorded? -->


Under section 4, we asked about data storage practices. 


<!-- Are these data entered and stored in SMART Desktop? -->

<!-- If none of the items are recorded in the corresponding SMART Conservation Area where are they recorded?  -->

Under section 5, we asked about the current state of SMART and its components. 

<!-- 21. What version of SMART Desktop is currently used in the protected area? -->
<!-- 22. Is SMART Connect available to manage and transfer information between SMART Desktop and SMART Mobile?  -->

<!-- 22.a Are there plans to set up SMART Connect instance and when? -->

<!-- 23. Is SMART fully rolled-out in the protected area(s) you work in or is it being piloted? -->


An introductory webpage explained that the survey was voluntary, anonymous, aimed at protected area managers administering SMART data. The webpage also clarified that clicking the "Start the survey" button constituted consent. The survey was built on Google Forms, which has a translation tool. We provided a tutorial on translating it into the preferred language (https://sites.google.com/wcs.org/smarttorecordwildlifehealth/home). The survey was exempt from IRB review (ref #22-53 Wildlife Conservation Society Internal Review Board).

The survey was distributed globally to the SMART Community (SMART Community Forum users https://forum.smartconservationtools.org/) by the SMART Partnership via email in October 2022, and it remained open for three months. As the closing date approached, a reminder was sent to the SMART Community three weeks in advance.

Responses could represent a single or multiple protected areas. However, our analysis focused on responses representing one or two individual terrestrial protected areas to gain insights into specific local realities. Therefore, responses representing more than two protected areas were filtered out. The resulting dataset could have a specific protected area represented by single responses, by responses that included two protected areas, or a combination of both. We duplicated the responses that were representing two protected areas but left a single protected area for each one, so each row in the dataset implied a unique protected area. One of the responses representing the same protected area after this step were filtered out to leave a unique representation completion and consistency of answers, and respondent's alignment with the intended target audience of the survey.

The protected areas included in the responses were classified as marine or terrestrial based on the World Database on Protected Areas (https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa?tab=WDPA). Marine protected areas were removed.

## Results

### General results

The total number of responses was `r nrow(dat_modified_filtered)`. 

`r as.character(english::as.english(length(given_names))) |> stringr::str_to_title()` responses were removed because they included a given name instead of the protected area name and `r as.character(english::as.english(length(unknown_protected_areas)))` response was removed because it did not have a protected area name. `r as.character(english::as.english(nrow(dat_modified_filtered_1) - nrow(dat_modified_filtered_2))) |> stringr::str_to_sentence()` responses representing more than two protected areas were filtered out and other `r as.character(english::as.english(nrow(dat_modified_filtered_2) - nrow(dat_modified_filtered_3)))` were removed because they involved protected areas that were represented once already. `r as.character(english::as.english(nrow(dat_modified_filtered_3) - nrow(dat_modified_filtered_4))) |> stringr::str_to_sentence()` responses were removed because the respondent did not match the target audience. 


The final dataset described below excluded `r as.character(english::as.english(nrow(dat_modified_filtered_expanded |> filter(terrestrial=="no"))))` marine protected areas leading to the removal of another `r as.character(english::as.english(length(unique(dat_modified_filtered_4$survey)) - length(unique(terrestrial_data$survey))))` responses, for a total of `r nrow(terrestrial_data)` protected areas represented by `r length(unique(terrestrial_data$survey))` answered surveys (`r number_pas_per_response |> filter(number_pas==1) |> pull(responses)` responses representing a single protected area and `r number_pas_per_response |> filter(number_pas==2) |> pull(responses)` representing two protected areas) from `r length(unique(terrestrial_data$country))` countries.

### Section 1: Perceptions regarding wildlife health and potential consequences of pathogen transmission among wildlife, domestic animals and people

<!-- Under section 1, we asked managers to rank their perceptions regarding wildlife health  -->
<!-- and potential consequences of pathogen transmission among wildlife, domestic -->
<!-- animals and people. -->

<!-- Wildlife health, including infectious and non-infectious diseases, is important to achieve the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work -->

<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect livestock health    -->

<!-- Pathogens carried by wildlife inhabiting the protected area I work in can affect public health -->

<!-- Human or livestock pathogens can affect wildlife populations inhabiting the protected area I work  -->

The ranking distribution with the overall agreement with the affirmations odf section is shown in Figure 1.

The most common ranking combination for the four affirmations was "`r affirmation_combinations_count |> filter(number_responses==max(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)) |> select(-number_responses) |> tibble::deframe()`" with the four affirmations (n=`r max(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)`; `r round(max(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)/sum(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)*100,1)`%), followed by "`r affirmation_combinations_count |> filter(number_responses==unique(sort(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses, decreasing = TRUE))[2]) |> select(-number_responses) |> tibble::deframe()`" (n=`r unique(sort(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses, decreasing = TRUE))[2]`; `r round(unique(sort(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses, decreasing = TRUE))[2]/sum(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)*100,1)`% of the responses). `r as.character(english::as.english(affirmation_combinations_count |> ungroup() |> filter(if_all(-number_responses, ~grepl("Strongly agree|Agree", . ))) |> pull(number_responses) |> sum())) |> stringr::str_to_sentence()` (`r round(affirmation_combinations_count |> ungroup() |> filter(if_all(-number_responses, ~grepl("Strongly agree|Agree", . ))) |> pull(number_responses) |> sum()/sum(affirmation_combinations_count$number_responses)*100,2)`%) of the respondents answered either "Strongly agree" or "Agree" to the four affirmations. The ranking combinations and number of responses are provided in Appendix 1.

The most common combination of methods to register either sick, injured, or dead wildlife was the recording of dead wildlife by itself with each dead individual as a unique observation  (`r round(max(how_combinations_count$number_responses)/sum(how_combinations_count$number_responses)*100,1)`% of the responses), followed by "`r how_combinations_count |> filter(number_responses==unique(sort(how_combinations_count$number_responses, decreasing = TRUE))[2]) |> select(-number_responses) |> tibble::deframe()`" for the three health categories (`r round(unique(sort(how_combinations_count$number_responses, decreasing = TRUE))[2]/sum(how_combinations_count$number_responses)*100,1)`% of the responses). The number of responses per method used per health category are provided in Appendix 2.

Health data storage in a SMART database across widlife health status category for the subset of responses reporting the recording of sick, injured, or dead wildlife is shown in Figure 9 (percentages). When sick, injured, or dead wildlife were recorded but their data was not stored in a SMART database ("None of these items are entered in a SMART database"), a range of options were employed instead, including paper forms, reports, and spreadsheets.

Protected area data managers reported that `r smart_use_for_text %>% pull(n) %>% nth(1)` areas had SMART `r tolower(smart_use_for_text %>% pull(smart_fully_rolled_out))[1]`, `r smart_use_for_text %>% pull(n) %>% nth(2)` had SMART `r tolower(smart_use_for_text %>% pull(smart_fully_rolled_out))[2]`, and `r smart_use_for_text %>% pull(n) %>% nth(3)` had SMART `r tolower(smart_use_for_text %>% pull(smart_fully_rolled_out))[3]`. The most common SMART Desktop version by the time of the survey was SMART `r smart_version_for_text %>% arrange(-n) %>%  pull(smart_version) %>% nth(1)`, used in `r smart_version_for_text %>% arrange(-n) %>%  pull(n) %>% nth(1)` protected areas. SMART 7 was already used in `r smart_version_for_text %>% filter(smart_version%in% c("7")) %>% pull(n)` protected areas by the time of the survey. Older SMART versions (4 and 5) were used in `r smart_version_for_text %>% filter(smart_version%in% c("4", "5")) %>% pull(n) %>% sum()` of the `r nrow(terrestrial_data)` protected areas. Finally, SMART Connect was available in `r smart_connect_for_text %>% filter(smart_connect=="Yes") %>% pull(n) %>% nth(1)` protected areas to manage and transfer information between SMART Desktop and SMART Mobile, but `r smart_connect_set_up_for_text` of the `r smart_connect_for_text %>% filter(smart_connect=="No") %>% pull(n) %>% nth(1)` protected areas without SMART Connect are planning to set it up.

## Discussion

We developed a web-based questionnaire aimed at protected area managers around the globe to learn about their perceptions regarding wildlife health; the monitoring of dead, sick, and injured wildlife and domestic animals in protected areas; health data storage practices at these sites; and local status of SMART. We obtained 71 valid responses from protected area managers that involved 76 protected areas administered with the support of a version of SMART  distributed in 19 countries. Responses from stakeholders strongly suggest that large amounts of valuable and syndromic no-cost data for One Health surveillance are being lost due to non-collection, non-standard recording, or inadequate management. 

Managers usually considered wildlife health as relevant for conservation goals of protected areas and they understand that pathogens can be transmitted and among wildlife, humans, and livestock and impact any of these groups. Several managers confirmed that dead, sick, or injured wildlife are observed at least "very rarely" but 25% to over 50% of them, depending on the wildlife health status category, reported non-recording of these animals when found during patrols. These contradictory answers could be explained by recent global pathogen-driven crises such as SARS-CoV-2, H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Ebola Fever virus, and African Swine Fever virus that might have sensitized our audience by the time the survey was responded but before eventual new health-associated monitoring objectives could be planned and rolled-out in the represented conservation sites. Most valid responses (`r terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>%  select(n) %>% max()`; `r  round(terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>% select(n) %>% max()/ terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>%  select(n) %>% sum *100,2)`%) came from `r terrestrial_data %>% distinct(survey, country) %>% count(country) %>% arrange(-n) %>% filter(n==max(n)) %>% pull(country)` where two major wildlife die-offs have recently occurred: H5N1 HPAI since November 2022 (Paulo citation), after the survey was closed, and the largest oil-spill in its history in January 2022, before the survey was sent. After excluding responses from this country, the distribution of perceptions regarding wildlife health and recording of dead, sick, or injured wildlife remain (Appendix 3), so neither of these die-offs or particular Peruvian responses explained the contradiction.  

The subgroup of managers representing protected areas where sick, injured, or dead wildlife found during patrols are recorded provided several methodologies to register these animals (present/absent, individually, or grouped within a species) and they could be different within the same response depending on wildlife health status (e.g., sick versus dead wildlife). Specific information collected also varied across and within each wildlife group (demographic data, signs in animals, etc.) with only species and photographs being consistently recorded. Although harmonization of data is a foundational pillar of wildlife health surveillance systems (Lawson et al. 2021; Sleeman et al. 2012; Stephen et al. 2018; Merianos 2007; Worsley-Tonks et al. 2022; World Bank and Food and Agriculture O...; Pruvot et al. 2023; Machalaba et al. 2021; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; World Organisation for Animal Health ...; Stephen and Berezowski 2022; Ryser-Degiorgis 2013; Hayman et al. 2023; World Organisation for Animal Health ...)  these responses are not be surprising as data standards have been absent in wildlife health historically and globally (e.g., artois 2009 Machalaba, Heiderich, 2023). This scenario can seriously limit the value of health monitoring data from protected areas, hindering the generation of meaningful information, sharing, and timely health assessments within and across conservation sites or beyond.

Most managers "Agree" or "Strongly agree" with the affirmation "Introduced domestic animals (e.g., dogs, cats, cattle, pigs, cats) are a concern for the conservation goals of the protected areas where I work" and reported the presence of these animals in the protected area(s). Most responses also confirmed the recording of domestic animals but only a minority reported the registration of their health status. Wildlife can be impacted by domestic animals directly through predation, competition, inter-breeding, or disturbance and indirectly through land-use change (citation). Further, pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife can seriously harm biodiversity conservation efforts. Documented evidence has shown that domestic animal sourced pathogens can cause the extinction of species and disrupt entire ecosystems. Examples include Canine distemper and Pest du Petit Ruminants viruses, *Pastereulla multocida* or *Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis*, *Sarcoptes scabiei* and many others (citations()).  In a world with active encroachment into natural habitats, ubiquitous stressors for wildlife, and continuous disease emergence at human-wildlife-livestock interfaces, we encourage the documentation and categorization of domestic animals found in protected areas by health status.

SMART is available to support the management of protected areas; however, health information was not necessarily managed using a SMART database. The alternatives mentioned almost guarantee information sparsity and the loss of health data. Adequate data management, including the use of appropriate databases, is another foundational pillar of wildlife health surveillance systems; however, most countries do not have such systems and flawed data governance remains a common pitfall. Consequently, these responses are also not surprising but it is important to remark that SMART databases are ready to support the adequate management of ranger-collected health data.

Ranger health data has supported risk assessments, establishment of trends, and serve as early warning systems for disease outbreaks and survey responses confirm that rangers can detect non-healthy wildlife including dead animals. Currently, there are approximately 280,000 rangers worldwide and it is estimated that 1.5 million will be needed by 2030 to properly fulfill the goal to protect 30% of the planet. The current and projected number of rangers reveals the unique cost-effective potential of their recruitment as "health sentinels" and address fundamental gaps in global health security.  

However, survey responses revealed several issues must be addressed. First, the standardized documentation of dead, sick injured, and health animals is imperative. A clear definition of a health event for the "ranger audience" that encompasses wildlife and domestic animals stratified by health status, free-ranging or not, within a specified spatio-temporal unit must be established. The variables to be recorded from each event must also be defined and they should include environmental findings, photographs, species, health status, anomalies observed, and potential causes of disease, injury, or death among others without adding major burden to their duties. Secondly, a database to guarantee the proper governance of ranger documented health events must be put in place. SMART is a sustainable and long-term developed technology that can help addressing these two limitations and move forward to establish a common set of standards not only within protected area agencies jurisdictions but beyond country boundaries and build a ranger-based army of planetary health workers with their boots on the ground and eyes on the field. Although rangers and SMART are already on site, resources and training to bridge their health monitoring capacities must not be discounted.

The vision to build this army has already started. WildHealthNet, a Wildlife Conservation Society initiative, focuses on creating national surveillance networks and codifying their Standard Operation Procedures (Denstedt et al. 2021, Porco et al. 2023, Pruvot et al. 2023). Under WildHealthNet, rangers are explicitly included as health sentinels in protected areas capitalizing on contemporary SMART technology. Currently, rangers from Lao, Peru, and Guatemala have been integrated into health monitoring using the same standards and rangers from Cambodia and Madagascar will be engaged during 2024. 

## Conclusions

The information collected through our survey suggests that: i) protected area managers tend to considered wildlife health as relevant for the conservation goals of protected areas and there is a general understanding from these stakeholders that pathogens can be transmitted among wildlife, humans, and livestock and impact any of these groups; ii) dead, sick, or injured wildlife might not be recorded if found during ranger patrols in protected areas; iii) dead, sick, and injured wildlife found in patrols and documented are recorded following different methodologies within and among protected areas; iv) domestic animals tend to be considered a concern for the conservation goals of protected areas by protected area managers, they are usually observed within their boundaries and recorded, but their health status is mostly not documented; v) health data collected from protected areas supported by SMART might not be properly managed as this information is either not stored or it is partially stored in a SMART database and the alternatives employed are not adequate. Consequently, large amounts of valuable syndromic non-cost data for health monitoring collected by rangers that could be included in One Health surveillance systems are currently being lost. With the right strategies, technology, and investments, rangers can play a crucial role in monitoring health.
