Reproduce the manuscript "Wildlife health perceptions and monitoring practices in globally distributed protected areas" posted in https://ecoevorxiv.org/. 

To reproduce the manuscript open SMART_survey.qmd and render it. In SMART_survey.qmd, only the chunks with data without country and protected area are evaluated (terrestrial_data.RDS). This is to protect the identity of the respondents. 
For the same reason, the raw dataset with protected areas and country names is not publicly available. Scripts with country names or protected area names (those in the sections not evaluated in SMART_survey.qmd are also not publicly available.
Only the dataset without protected area names and countries is provided (terrestrial_data.RDS).
