Reproduce the manuscript "Wildlife Health Perceptions and Monitoring Practices in Globally Distributed Protected Areas" posted at https://ecoevorxiv.org/. 

To reproduce the manuscript (SMART_survey.pdf), open SMART_survey.qmd and render it. In SMART_survey.qmd, only the chunks with data without country and protected area are evaluated (terrestrial_data.RDS). This is to protect the respondents' identities. 
The raw dataset (survey_responses.csv and survey_responses.xlsx) and R scripts (R/clean_pa_names.R and R/classify_pa.R) with protected areas and country names are not publicly available for the same reason.
The dataset without protected area names and countries is provided (terrestrial_data.RDS). 

To reproduce the appendix (Appendix_final.html) open and render Appendix_final.qmd
